# [NYPD Patrol Guide](https://doctorhammer.github.io/NYPDPatrolGuide/)


A static webpage to help view the Patrol Guide from any device.

Single-page design is great for searching for specific text using Control+F keyboard shortcut.

Rather view/download a traditional PDF? There's a link at the very top of the site.
